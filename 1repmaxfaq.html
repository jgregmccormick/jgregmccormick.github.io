<h4> What is a 1 rep max?</h4>
<p><span style="line-height: 1.5em;">One rep maximum (one repetition maximum or 1RM) in weight training is the maximum amount of weight one can lift in a single repetition for a given exercise.  This app is used to help with daily training.  You can find many programs that ask you to lift a percentage lower of your max each day.</span></p>
<h4><span style="line-height: 1.5em;">What formula is used to calculate the MAX in 1RepMax?</span></h4>
<p>Epley Formula: 1RM = w ( 1 + {r}/{30})</p>
<p>There are other formulas including upper and lower body versions that are available.  We will be adding those in the future.</p>
<h4><span style="line-height: 1.5em;">Who made this app?</span></h4>

<h4>What happened to the Old look of 1RepMax?  I really liked it a lot better.</h4>
<p>We are happy to hear you liked the old version.  But it was time to clean up a little and modernize.<span style="line-height: 1.5em;"> </span></p>
