 

 What is a 1 rep max?

One rep maximum (one repetition maximum or 1RM) in weight training is the maximum amount of weight one can lift in a single repetition for a given exercise.  This app is used to help with daily training.  You can find many programs that ask you to lift a percentage lower of your max each day.

What formula is used to calculate the MAX in 1RepMax?

Epley Formula: 1RM = w ( 1 + {r}/{30})

There are other formulas including upper and lower body versions that are available.  We will be adding those in the future.

What happened to the Old look of 1RepMax?  I really liked it a lot better.

We are happy to hear you liked the old version.  But it was time to clean up a little and modernize.
